Here is **Dianfu Zhou**(周电富).<br>

I'm a incoming M.S. at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/) (ranked 1st in recommendation-exempt admission), now a senior student in information security at [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://www.nuaa.edu.cn/).

During my undergraduate studies, I acquire a solid foundation in computer science and am passionate about large language models, large model security, AI in education.
